The default Box Select in Blender doesn't change object activation. Because it is unclear which object should become active when multiple objects are selected.

This is painful for animators using a pen tablet. In Object Mode, Box Select can't make armature active. You must click to make armature active.

This add-on adds two new selection tools, Smart Box Select and Smart Lasso Select. These tools automatically set the object closest from the mouse cursor as the active object.

Shift drag to extend, Ctrl drag to subtract selection.
